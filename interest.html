<h3 style="color: peru; font-style: oblique;"> Should young people obey their elders without question?<br> Give examples to support your views, which can be from your own experience if you wish.
    Almost in every part of the world, listening to the older ones than you is like a tradition which has been now going on for centuries. <br>As a child, you always listen to your mother and as a student you always do whatever you are told by you teachers without and hesitation. Even though this may seem respectful seeing back the generations but now a days teens seem it as a hit to their ego when they are asked to do something without given a proper reason why they should do so?
         Being a teen, I support that we should be allowed to question our elder's intentions.<br> Youngsters are not obliged to fulfill their elders commands without questioning like some puppets they have the whole right to ask that why are their asked to do so. It may seem like the elders always have a good reason behind their decisions but then the reasons behind their actions are not always rainbows and sunshine. I believe that just like us the elders also have many problems in their life and they have not always made the right decision. There is a saying that "learning has no specific age" so throughout our life we keep learning from our wrong decisions and the mistakes we make. Even the elder people have gone through the hard times just like us and not always they have made the right decisions. May be they also regretted on their actions, learned from their mistakes but then again happen to repeat the same mistake! So there is nothing we can be fully reliable on. There is always 50-50 for any decision to be correct. Even when your elders tell you to do something this way rather than that way, we should always be able to question their intentions. We shouldnâ€™t do anything without knowing the reason why we did it because it will end up being meaningless for us. Despite being our elders, not all of them are our well-wishers. So rather that depending on the elders to take your decisions you yourself should be calling the shots.

    <h3 style="color: rosybrown; font-style: oblique;"> THE NOISIEST PLACE I KNOW<br>Last time when I went to Korea with my family, I got to experience a lot of new things there which I was not accessible in Nepal. One of them was on the railway station in Delhi, when I had to travel to Jeju. Seoul being the capital city of Korea, it was well developed and most of the people seemed literate too but then the case was different when it came to railway station. As it was my first time visiting a railway station, I had had quite a different image of it in my mind than it was in the real.
        Great white pillars hold the crafted iron boards which had been rusting under the attack from rain, on which the platforms numbers were written. <br> Chaotic noises fill the inside: the quick paced footsteps of travelers searching for their train or train times and the frantic voice of the tannoy alerting people where to go. 
        When the train arrives, all are anxious to get and occupy a seat. The passengers who want to get down at the station open the doors. Others who are to get into the train, try to get into the train. Thus a deadlock is created. After better counsels take place the in-going passengers make way for the out-going ones and let them pass. There is on room enough for a few passengers in every compartment, but not enough for all the passengers. Thus who get in, sit in their seats or remain standing. Other run up and down the platform to find a vacant seat. When they fail to get any seat inside, they catch hold of the handle outside some carriage and stand at the footboard. Each time a train left, it gave the feeling as if a World war was finished.
