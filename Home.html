       <h3 style= "font-style: oblique; color: lightslategrey;"> Hy! This is drishti. I am 15 years and currently studying in Budhanilkantha school in Grade 10. I have been living in KTM since my childhood and I recently moved to Lalitpur. As covid keeps spreading, I have just been staying at Home. Its been long since we went to school so I am missong my frinds and school too. Actually, its very much fun to stay with yur friends at scul as we all are there struggling, living together it makes us even more close with each other. Everyone is so helpful and we really go well with each other. This memories really mean a lot to me. But now it feels llike we have been wasting all of our golden times staying at home. Its true that this time will never come back but then still we are not able to ultilize it, so these can be taken as negative effects of lockdown.<br>
    Actually my aim is to beacome a succesful Dermatologist. I really want to do it but i am not so confident in myself and as time is going I keep loosing my confidence and feel like i cannot do it. One of the Reasons is think that there is not much scope of Dermatologist in Nepal so one of the way is that I should go in other asian countries like Korea and Japan as people there really care about dermats but again I dont think I will be able to go in a foreign land all alone leaving my family behind. But still I know I should keep going and One day I know I wll make it to my dream so everyone, Fighting!!  </h3>
